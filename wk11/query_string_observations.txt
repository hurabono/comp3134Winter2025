Date: 2025-04-08

[Scenario 1: Enter the correct English word]
- Action: Type "security" in the search form and submit it.
- Results: The site normally outputs definitions and relevant information about "security".
- Observation:
- The page loads normally, displays word definitions and related examples.
- There are no errors or warning messages.

-------------------------------------------------

[Scenario 2: Enter the wrong word in the URL]
- Action: Enter /browse/ followed by "cyberseczzz" at the URL address.
- Result: Site does not find a search result for "cyberseczzz" or outputs an error message.
- Observation:
- A prompt is displayed such as "The word does not exist" or "No search results".
- The page style or layout is not broken.

-------------------------------------------------

[Scenario 3: Type the script tag in the form]
- Operation: Type '<script>alert('hello')</script>' in the search form and submit it.
- Result: The code you entered is still output as a string, and the script does not run.
- Observation:
- The JavaScript alert window (alert) does not appear within the page.
- The tags you entered are escaped or removed and displayed as simple text.

-------------------------------------------------

[Scenario 4: Add script tag to URL query string]
- Action: Enter after adding '<script>alert('hello')</script>' to the /browse/term= part of the URL.
- Result: Web pages don't run scripts, code is handled securely and is displayed as a string on the screen.
- Observation:
- Verified that the web page has security mitigation measures applied safely against XSS attacks.
- Displays the result that the input script code is encoded or filtered.

-------------------------------------------------

Additional Notes:
- In each scenario, it is better to check the browser's console log or error messages, and changes in the HTML code on the page.
- If possible, recording the name and location of the screenshot file for each result will be convenient for future reports.
