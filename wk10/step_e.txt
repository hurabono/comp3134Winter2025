Problem 1 (unnecessary path access) mitigation:
- Use baseline() on the entered path to restrict unnecessary parent directory access.
- This allows access to folders less than /var/www/html.

Problem 2 (Access to non-existent folders) Mitigate:
- Use the file_exists() and is_dir() functions to verify that the requested folder actually exists.
- If it does not exist, the script stops and outputs the appropriate error message.
