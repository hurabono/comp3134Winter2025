Using PHP comments instead of HTML comments prevents sensitive information from being exposed 
in the clientâ€™s browser because PHP code is executed on the server side. When the server processes a PHP script,
it removes all PHP comments before sending the generated output to the client. 

Therefore, any comments written in PHP are never part of the HTML output that the browser receives. 
In contrast, HTML comments are sent directly to the client as part of the page's source code, making them visible when a user views the page source. 
This behavior means that including sensitive details in HTML comments could unintentionally reveal important information to users.
